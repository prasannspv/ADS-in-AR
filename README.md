# Getting started with Augmented Reality
The aim of this pet-project is to identify the potential markers in a noisy and an unstable video and overlay another video bounded by the markers. 
This can be used in advertising where AR systems can look for a set of markers in a scene and display an advertisement within the marker boundary.
